# Personal hygiene app

## About 
This was an app made using Corona SDK (now Solar2D) that I made for my 2020 NCEA technology scholarship project. The purpose of this app was to teach people good hygiene practices during the COVID-19 pandemic by showing them interactive step by step tutorials and videos. For instance, washing hands, wearing a face mask and coughing etiquette.

## Outcomes
From this project, I learnt how to make basic phone apps and basic UI design.
