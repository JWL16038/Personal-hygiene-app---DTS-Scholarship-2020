# Personal hygiene app

## About 
This was an app made using Corona SDK (now Solar2D) that I developed for my 2020 NCEA technology scholarship project. The purpose of this app is to teach people good hygiene practices during the COVID-19 pandemic by showing them interactive step by step tutorials and videos. Some features include interactive tutorials on washing hands, wearing a face mask and practicing coughing etiquette.

## Outcomes
From this project, I learnt the basics on how to make a simple phone app with a specific purpose and the basics of mobile UI design. I applied the SCRUM methodology to manage the development process for this project.
